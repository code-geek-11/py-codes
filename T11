Hi, I would need your help in creating a Roadmap. I am using Qlik Replicate in our existing data framework. In future ,  I am planning to replace it with Azure databricks. First, I will explain in detail about the usage of Qlik replicate in our framework as is. I would like you to understand the existing framework and usage of Qlik replicate in detail. Later, I will provide you the Roadmap phase and I would need your help in creating the roadmap for each of the phase I am providing one by one. In future I am planning to migrate from Qlik replicate to Azure databricks 
ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Please go ahead and provide the details about the existing framework and the usage of Qlik Replicate in your setup. Once I have a good understanding of your current environment, we can move on to the roadmap phases for migrating to Azure Databricks.





In the existing  platform, we have all 3 environments Dev , UAT and PROD. But the deployment between these environments happens manually by exporting and importing packages . Also, the codes are managed internally and not inside any GIT repository. There is a huge lack of training materials for this platform. The upgrades in this environment is a tedious task which is taking almost 3 months. The cost of the license is high.  This just used as a data copy tool. There are almost 14 replicate tasks among which only 2 are scheduled to run directly in replicate and remaining 12 are scheduled to run as a task in Qlik compose workflow. The source of the replicate either comes from ESIDUB.esnet.ie or it comes from data share \\cefil0203.esnet.ie\data03\. Among the 14 Replicate tasks, 9 are full load and the remaining 5 are change data capture. The data sink is always SQL server which is tables associate with x90 database or Data lake IEQPS001_GIDATALAKE database
