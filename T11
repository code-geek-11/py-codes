I am in the process of creating Roadmap for migration from SAS to Databricks. The Road is for September 2024 to December 2027. 

I will explain about the current SAS environment we have in our existing architecture and also I will also let you know about different phases in the roadmap one by one. Can you let me know the duration of each phases and also what can be done in each phase
ChatGPT
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you outline the phases of your migration roadmap from SAS to Databricks. Please go ahead and provide the details of your current SAS environment and the different phases you have planned. I'll then assist you with determining the duration for each phase and what activities should be included.





I will first let you know the current SAS framework. Then I will talk about each phases one by one 
ChatGPT
Sounds like a good plan. Please go ahead and describe your current SAS framework. Once you provide that information, we can move on to discussing each phase of the migration roadmap.





There are around 78 suites in our SAS framework. A suite here refers to a set of programs associated with a business functionality. There are no advanced analytical capabilities. Instead , only basic transformations are happening in the SAS. It extracts data from an application called i90 which is residing in IBM db2 for iseries, also it extracts data from SQL server. The codes are not managed in any git repository. Instead all are managed in windows data share. All dev, uat and production environment are residing in the same windows server. The data created by it is also loaded into the datashare. There are no CI/CD or any devops happening. Instead the changes are deployed manually. There are no machine learning capabilities. Also, the cost of the license seems to be high . They have license for both server and client separately. Upgrade has happened around 4 to 5 times in the last 27 years. It is used by various consumers of the Insurance industry such as Reserving, Pricing, Claims, Tax, Finance, Underwriting,  Agency. Also, the output of this framework is either CSV report directly sent to the consumer or it is used for visualization by Tableau or SAP business objects 
ChatGPT
Thanks for providing the details about your current SAS framework. Based on your description, the SAS environment is relatively basic with several limitations, such as the absence of advanced analytics, lack of CI/CD processes, manual deployment, and high licensing costs. Here is a summary of your current SAS framework:

Suites: 78 suites (sets of programs) associated with business functionalities.
Analytical Capabilities: Basic transformations, no advanced analytics or machine learning.
Data Sources: Extracts data from i90 (IBM DB2 for iSeries) and SQL Server.
Code Management: Codes are managed in a Windows data share, not in a git repository.
Environments: Dev, UAT, and production environments are on the same Windows server.
