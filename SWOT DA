Strengths

- Established use of tools like SAS, Tableau, SAP Business Objects, and SQL Server for data analytics.
Experienced team with expertise in traditional data analytics tools.
Ability to handle large volumes of data using established ETL processes.
- Utilization of both on-premise and cloud-based tools allows for some level of flexibility.

weakness
- Lack of advanced analytics capabilities, such as AI/ML, limiting deeper data insights.
- Multiple tools performing similar functions, leading to fragmented and inefficient analytics processes.
- Limited real-time analytics capabilities.
 Absence of a centralized data model results in inconsistent analytics and reporting.
- Manual data integration and transformation processes increase the likelihood of errors and reduce agility.
- Data silos limit cross-functional insights.
- Heavy reliance on legacy systems like SAS, which are complex and difficult to maintain.
- No automated deployment or CI/CD pipeline, leading to slower analytics deployment cycles.
- High operational costs due to multiple tool usage.
- Lack of documentation and standardized processes makes it difficult to scale or modify analytics workflows.
- Inability to perform predictive analytics and scenario modeling.
- Disconnected workflows reduce efficiency.

Opportunities

Transitioning to a unified platform like Databricks could streamline analytics workflows, improve performance, and reduce costs.
Implementing AI/ML and predictive analytics could provide deeper insights and enable proactive decision-making.
Leveraging automated deployment and CI/CD pipelines could accelerate analytics delivery and improve accuracy
Centralizing data models could improve consistency, accuracy, and the overall quality of analytics across the organization.

Threats

- Resistance to adopting new tools and technologies within the team.
- Potential data loss or corruption during the transition to new analytics platforms.
- Increased competition from other companies with more advanced analytics capabilities.
- High costs and complexities involved in migrating legacy analytics systems to a modern platform.
- Dependence on legacy systems may limit the ability to quickly adopt new analytics capabilities.
- Rapid changes in technology could outpace adaptation.
- Potential difficulties in integrating current analytics workflows with new AI/ML capabilities.
- Security risks associated with handling sensitive data during the transition to more advanced analytics platforms.
- Skill gaps within the team in advanced analytics and AI/ML may slow down the adoption of new capabilities.
- Vendor lock-in with existing analytics tools could limit flexibility and innovation.
