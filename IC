This architecture evaluation document provides a comprehensive assessment of our current data framework, which is primarily built on legacy technologies such as SAS, SQL Server, Tableau, SAP Business Objects, Qlik Compose, and Qlik Replicate. As our organization moves towards embracing advanced analytics and AI/ML capabilities, we are evaluating the limitations and inefficiencies of our existing architecture. This document explores the challenges associated with maintaining multiple, overlapping tools, the lack of modern data management practices, and the absence of centralized data models. It also highlights the need for a unified platform that can streamline our data processes, reduce costs, and provide a scalable foundation for future growth. By transitioning to a more integrated and flexible architecture, we aim to enhance our data analytics capabilities, improve operational efficiency, and unlock deeper business insights.

Conclusion Paragraph
In conclusion, the evaluation of our current architecture reveals significant challenges and limitations that hinder our ability to fully leverage data for strategic decision-making. The existing framework, while robust in certain areas, is outdated and fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and high operational costs. As we transition towards a more modern, cloud-based architecture with Databricks on Azure, we have the opportunity to overcome these challenges and build a more agile, scalable, and cost-effective data environment. By integrating advanced AI/ML capabilities, automating processes, and centralizing our data models, we can position our organization for future success, enabling more sophisticated analytics and driving better business outcomes. This document serves as a roadmap for this transformation, outlining the steps needed to achieve a more efficient and innovative data architecture
