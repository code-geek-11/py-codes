I asked for the price of databricks to use in my organisation. We have a unit who manages this. I asked them. But they have given me the following pricing and it seems relatively much higher than we were expecting 

I will give you the details and help me understand the pricing to a better level

1. Service management - 40k/years
2. Storage : 74k for 5 to 25 TB out of which 50k for pure infrastructure and 24 k for platform management 
3. 2h ingestion into the platform contributes to 18k out of 13k for infra and 5k for platforms management 
4. 64k for consumption part - 50k for infra and 14 k for platform management 
5. 12k for managing 3 environments (production, uat, dev)

To better understand the pricing details provided for Databricks, let's break down each of the listed items:

1. Service Management - $40k/year
What it means: This typically covers the ongoing management of the Databricks service. It could include support, maintenance, updates, and general oversight to ensure that the Databricks environment is running smoothly.
Commentary: $40k annually seems standard for enterprise-level support, especially if it includes premium services.
2. Storage - $74k for 5 to 25 TB
Breakdown:
$50k for Pure Infrastructure: This is likely the cost for the raw storage space, possibly on cloud platforms like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.
$24k for Platform Management: This fee probably covers the management of the storage platform itself, ensuring data is accessible, secure, and properly integrated with Databricks.
Commentary: Storage costs can vary widely based on the provider and the type of storage (e.g., SSD vs. HDD, hot vs. cold storage). This seems a bit on the higher side unless it's highly optimized for performance or involves additional data management services.
3. 2h Ingestion into the Platform - $18k
Breakdown:
$13k for Infrastructure: This likely represents the cost of the compute resources used for ingesting data into Databricks, possibly related to the data pipeline tools or servers running ETL processes.
$5k for Platform Management: This would be the cost for managing these ingestion processes, including monitoring, scheduling, and error handling.
Commentary: This cost might seem steep for 2 hours of ingestion, but it could involve complex processes or large volumes of data requiring significant compute power.
4. Consumption Part - $64k
Breakdown:
$50k for Infrastructure: This seems to cover the compute resources used for running workloads in Databricks, including data processing, analytics, and possibly machine learning workloads.
$14k for Platform Management: This covers the operational management of these consumption processes, ensuring they run efficiently and within set parameters.
Commentary: $64k is a significant amount, but if you're running heavy workloads, especially in production environments, it could be reasonable depending on the usage patterns.
5. Managing 3 Environments (Production, UAT, Dev) - $12k
What it means: This likely covers the overhead of managing multiple environments within Databricks, ensuring separation of concerns (e.g., keeping development changes from impacting production).
Commentary: $12k for three environments seems standard, though it depends on the level of complexity and the management involved.
Overall Commentary
Total Cost: If we sum everything up, the total comes to $208k/year.
High-Level Breakdown:
Infrastructure Costs: A significant portion of your costs is going towards infrastructure, which includes storage and compute power.
Platform Management: A consistent theme is the additional cost associated with managing the platform, which adds up to around $57k/year.
Key Considerations:
Scale of Use: Are these costs in line with the scale of your organization’s usage? High costs might be justified if you’re dealing with large-scale data, complex ingestion processes, and heavy compute workloads.
Cloud Provider: Are these prices specific to a cloud provider? Sometimes costs are bundled depending on the provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Cost Optimization: Consider asking for a detailed breakdown or explore cost optimization options. There might be ways to reduce costs by optimizing storage, ingestion, or workload management.
If you feel the pricing is higher than expected, it may be worth discussing potential discounts, bundling options, or cost optimization strategies with your service management team or directly with Databricks.
