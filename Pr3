A detailed roadmap has been created to guide the migration from our existing tools to Databricks, starting with assessment and planning in early 2024, followed by phased migrations and AI/ML integrations through 2025 and 2026. This approach ensures minimal disruption while gradually decommissioning legacy systems and fully adopting the new platform. By 2026, we anticipate significant improvements in data processing efficiency, advanced analytics capabilities, and overall operational effectiveness, positioning us as a more agile and innovative player in the General Insurance industry.
