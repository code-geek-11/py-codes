In my organisation there are two parallel domains, one is General Insurance and the other is Life insurance. Both works separately. I lead the data team in General Insurance. We are responsible for delivering data driven insights to business. In our framework, we use legacy tools like SAS, Qlik compose/replicate, SQL server, SSIS, Sap Business objects and Tableau . All off these applications resides in on premise. We have a data strategy plan for 2024 to 2026 which is a three year plan. In this plan, we are planning to change the existing framework so as to use latest technologies to obtain advanced analytical capabilities in our framework. Hence, we have designing roadmaps for migration.
