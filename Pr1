The GI Data Strategy 2024-2026 focuses on transforming our data management approach by transitioning from a fragmented toolset to a unified, cutting-edge platform: Databricks. Currently, we use a variety of tools such as SAS, SQL Server, Tableau, and SAP Business Objects to handle our data processes. However, these legacy systems are limiting our ability to fully leverage our data for advanced insights and decision-making. The new strategy aims to replace these tools with Databricks, which offers scalable data processing, seamless integration of AI and machine learning, and a more efficient, unified approach to data analytics.
