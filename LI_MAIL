Dear [Life Insurance Point of Contactâ€™s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently working with the General Insurance division and am interested in exploring a life insurance policy for myself. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with details on the available life insurance plans. Additionally, I would like to know if there are any employee benefits or discounts applicable when taking a life insurance policy as a company employee.

Please let me know the process for initiating a new policy, along with any forms or documentation required.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.
